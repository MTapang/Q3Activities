<h2 align="center"><b>üìë SYNOPSIS üìë</b></h2>
<h4><b>The television show was composed of romance, hatred, and jealousy.
It did, however, appreciate the presence of each group's circle of
friends. With Deib and Max's difficult journey to battle for their
genuine love for each other, they never gave up and stayed true to 
their pledges. As the proverb goes, even though it is against the 
law or commandment, if it is really for you, love will find it's
own way back to you.</b></h4>
